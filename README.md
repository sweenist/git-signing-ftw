# git-signing-ftw
An example of signing commits

Commit #1: This is really me but I cannot prove it
Commit #2: Maybe I'll give some direction (While the director's away)
Commit #3: Turn on Vigilant Mode in github. Sign the commit
Commit #4: Another imposter?
Commit #5: testing whether my local repo will sign ssh if gpg-agent is running
